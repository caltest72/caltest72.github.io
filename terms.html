                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Occasionally, we look for beta testers to help us test our new features. These features will be identified as &ldquo;beta&rdquo;
                    or &ldquo;pre-release,&rdquo; or words or phrases with similar meanings (each, a &ldquo;Beta Product&rdquo;). Beta Products may not be ready for prime time so they are made available &ldquo;as is,&rdquo;
                    and any warranties or contractual commitments we make for other Services do not apply. Should you encounter any faults with our Beta Products, we would love to hear about them; our primary reason for running any beta programs is to iron out issues before making a new feature widely available.</span>

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example, reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly. We&rsquo;ll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We&rsquo;ll post notice of modified additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will control for that conflict.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">These terms control the relationship between Mazement and you. They do not create any third party beneficiary rights.</span>

                <p class="c1"><span class="c0">If it turns out that a particular term is not enforceable, this will not affect any other terms.</span>
